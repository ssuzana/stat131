## Why study Probability?

**Mathematics is the logic of certainty; probability is the logic of uncertainty.**

&lt;/br&gt;

- The field of probability originated from analyzing gambling and chance-based games.

- It underwent centuries of development before achieving a fully rigorous mathematical foundation. 

- Nowadays, probability is used in fields such as medicine, meteorology, photography from satellites, marketing, earthquake prediction, human behavior, the design of computer systems, finance, genetics, law, etc. 

- Mastering probability is key to navigating our uncertain world.

### Experiment, sample space and events
  
.definition-box[
An **experiment** is any process, real or hypothetical, in which the possible outcomes can be identified ahead of time.]

For example, flipping two coins is an experiment. 
--

.definition-box[
The **sample space** is the collection of all the possible outcomes of an experiment. The sample space can be finite or infinite.]
 
For example, when flipping two coins, write Heads as `\(H\)` and Tails as `\(T\)`. Then the corresponding sample space is `\(S=\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}\)`. 

--

.definition-box[
Any subset `\(E\)` of the sample space is known as an **event**. In other words, an event is a set consisting of possible outcomes of the experiment.]

Let `\(E\)` be the even that the two coins come up different. Then `\(E=\{HT, TH\}\)`. 


---

## Naive Definition of Probability

.definition-box[
If `\(S\)` is a finite nonempty sample space of equally likely outcomes, and `\(A\)` is an event, that is, a subset of `\(S\)`, then the **probability** of `\(A\)` is
`$$p(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}= \frac{\text{number of outcomes favorable to A}}{\text{total number of outcomes in S}},$$`
where `\(|A|\)` is the size (cardinality) of set `\(A\)`.]

--

- This definition assumes that experiments have finitely many, "equally likely" outcomes.

- It works well for simple scenarios like fair coin tosses or dice rolls.
 
--

- However, it becomes problematic when applied to more complex situations. For instance, it's not logical to claim that the probability of extraterrestrial life on the moon is 1/2 simply because there are two possible outcomes (existence or non-existence).

### Example (Rolling Two Dice)

.pull-left[**Experiment:** Rolling two dice. &lt;img src="img/red-white-dice.jpeg" height="80px" /&gt;]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/two-dice.png" height="160px" /&gt;
]

**Sample space:** 
`\(\{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6),\\ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6),\\ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\}\)`

--

**An event:**  Let `\(E\)` denote the event that the sum of the rolls is 4. 
Then `\(E=\{(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)\}\)` and
`\(p(E) =\frac{|E|}{|S|} = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}.\)`

--

**Another event:** Let `\(F\)` be the event that the two rolls are the same. 
Then `\(F=\{(i, i): i=1 \ldots 6\}\)` and `\(p(F) =\frac{|F|}{|S|} = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}.\)`

## Set Theory Notation

The sample space of an experiment can be thought of as a set, or collection, of different possible outcomes; and each outcome can be thought of as an element in the sample space. Similarly, events can be thought of as subsets of the sample space.


| English | Sets |
|---------|------|
| **Events and occurrences** | |
| sample space | `\(S\)` |
| `\(s\)` is a possible outcome | `\(s \in S\)` |
| `\(A\)` is an event | `\(A \subseteq S\)` |
| **New events from old events** | |
| `\(A\)` or `\(B\)` (inclusive) | `\(A \cup B\)` |
| `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` | `\(A \cap B\)` |
| not `\(A\)` | `\(A^c\)` (the complement of A)|
| `\(A\)` or `\(B\)`, but not both | `\((A \cap B^c) \cup (A^c \cap B)\)` |
| at least one of `\(A_1,\ldots,A_n\)` | `\(A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_n\)` |
| all of `\(A_1,\ldots,A_n\)` | `\(A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n\)` |
| **Relationships between events** | |
| `\(A\)` implies `\(B\)` | `\(A \subseteq B\)` |
| `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` are mutually exclusive | `\(A \cap B = \emptyset\)` |
| `\(A_1,\ldots,A_n\)` are a partition of `\(S\)` | `\(A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_n = S, A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset \text{ for } i \neq j\)` |

---
### De Morgan’s laws

Saying that it is not the case that at least one of `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` occur is the same as saying that `\(A\)` does not occur and `\(B\)` does not occur: 
`$$(A\cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$$`

--
Saying that it is not the case that both occur is the same as saying that at least one does not occur: .cbox[$$(A\cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$$]
--

Analogous results hold for unions and intersections of more than two events. Let `\(A_i\)`'s be events *(e.g., Person i has an umbrella)*. Then  

.pull-left[$$\left(\bigcup_i A_i\right)^c=\bigcap_i A_i^c$$

*Not true that someone has an umbrella. 
= Everyone doesn’t have an umbrella.*]

.pull-right[$$\left(\bigcap_i A_i\right)^c =\bigcup_i A_i^c$$

*Not true that everyone has an umbrella.
= Someone doesn't have an umbrella.*]

---

## Counting

Many basic probability problems involve counting. 

.theorem-box[
**Multiplication Principle**  Consider a compound experiment consisting of two sub-experiments: experiment `\(A\)` and experiment `\(B\)`. Suppose that experiment `\(A\)` has a possible outcomes, and for each of those outcomes experiment `\(B\)` has `\(b\)` possible outcomes. Then the compound experiment has `\(ab\)` possible outcomes.
]

--

**Example (Ice cream cones)** Suppose you are buying an ice cream cone. You can choose whether to have a cake cone or a waffle cone, and whether to have chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry as your flavor. 

.pull-left[This decision process can be visualized with a tree diagram.
Regardless of whether the type of cone or the flavor is chosen first, there are `\(2\cdot 3 = 3 \cdot 2 = 6\)` possibilities.
]

.pull-right[&lt;img src="img/ice-cream-choices.png" height="150px" /&gt;
]

---

.definition-box[
**Permutations and factorials** 
Suppose that `\(n\)` positions are to be filled with `\(n\)` different objects. There are `\(n\)` choices for filling the first position, `\(n − 1\)` for the second, ..., and `\(1\)` choice for the last position. So, by the multiplication principle, there are
`$$n\cdot (n − 1)\cdot \ldots \cdot 2\cdot 1 = n!$$`
possible arrangements. The symbol `\(n!\)` is read **“n factorial"**.
We define `\(0! = 1\)`; that is, we say that zero positions can be filled with zero objects in one way.

Each of the `\(n!\)` arrangements (in a row) of `\(n\)` different objects is called a **permutation** of the `\(n\)` objects.
]

For example, `\(3, 5, 1, 2, 4\)` is a permutation of `\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\)`.

**Example** The number of permutations of the four letters `\(a, b, c,\)` and `\(d\)` is `$$4! = 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = 24.$$` 

However, the number of possible four-letter code words using the four letters `\(a, b, c,\)` and `\(d\)` if letters may be repeated is `\(4^4 = 256\)`, because in this case each selection can
be performed in four ways.


---

.theorem-box[
**Sampling with replacement** Consider `\(n\)` objects and making `\(k\)` choices from them, one at a time with replacement (i.e., choosing a certain object does not preclude it from being chosen again). Then there are `\(n^k\)` possible outcomes (where order matters, in the sense that, e.g., choosing object 3 and then object 7 is counted as a different outcome than choosing object 7 and then object 3.)
]


For example, imagine a jar with `\(n\)` balls, labeled from `\(1\)` to `\(n\)`. We sample balls one at a time with replacement, meaning that each time a ball is chosen, it is returned to the jar. Each sampled ball is a sub-experiment with `\(n\)` possible outcomes, and there are `\(k\)` sub-experiments. Thus, by the multiplication rule there are 
`$$\underbrace{n\cdot n\cdot \ldots \cdot n}_{k \text{ times}} = n^k$$` ways to obtain a sample of size `\(k\)`.

**Example** A die is rolled seven times. Note that rolling a die is equivalent to sampling with replacement from the set `\(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}.\)`
The number of possible ordered samples is `\(6^7 = 279,936.\)`

---
.theorem-box[
**Sampling without replacement** Consider `\(n\)` objects and making `\(k\)` choices from them, one at a time without replacement (i.e., choosing a certain object precludes it from being chosen again). Then there are `$$n(n − 1) \ldots (n − k + 1)$$` possible outcomes for `\(1 \leq k \leq n\)`, and 0 possibilities for `\(k &gt; n\)` (where order matters). 
It is equivalent to the number of permutations of `\(n\)` objects taken `\(k\)` at a time and is denoted by `\(P(n,k)\)` or `\(_{n}P_{k}\)`.
]

In terms of factorials, we have
`$$P(n,k) = \frac{n(n − 1) \ldots (n − k + 1)(n-k)\cdot \ldots \cdot 2\cdot 1}{(n-k)\cdot \ldots \cdot 2\cdot 1} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$`

Again, imagine a jar with `\(n\)` balls, labeled from `\(1\)` to `\(n\)`. We sample balls one at a time without replacement, meaning that each time a ball is chosen, it is NOT returned to the jar. The number of possible choices decreases by 1 each time. The above result follows directly from the multiplication rule.

**Example** The number of possible four-letter code words, selecting from the 26 letters in the alphabet, in which all four letters are different is

--
`$$26 \cdot 25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 = 358,800.$$`
---

.definition-box[
**Binomial coefficient** For any nonnegative integers `\(k\)` and `\(n\)`, the binomial coefficient `\(n\choose k\)`, read as "n choose k", is the number of subsets of size `\(k\)` from a set of `\(n\)` elements. Algebraically, binomial coefficients can be computed as follows. For `\(k &gt; n\)`, `\({n\choose k} = 0\)`. For `\(k \leq n\)`, we have 
 `$${n\choose k}=\frac{n\cdot(n − 1)\cdot\ldots\cdot(n − k + 1)}{k!}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$$`

]

Sets and subsets are by definition **unordered**, e.g., `\(\{3, 1, 4\}=\{4, 1, 3\}\)`, so we are counting the number of ways to choose `\(k\)` objects out of `\(n\)`, without replacement and without distinguishing between the different orders.

There are `\(n\cdot(n − 1)\cdot\ldots\cdot(n − k + 1)\)` ways to make an ordered choice of `\(k\)` elements without replacement. This overcounts each subset of interest by a factor of `\(k!\)` (since we don’t care how these elements are ordered), so we can get the correct count by dividing by `\(k!\)`.

**Example** The number of possible five-card hands (in five-card poker) drawn from a deck of 52 playing cards is `\({52\choose 5}\)`.

``` r
choose(52,5)
```

```
## [1] 2598960
```
---

### Deck of Cards

A "standard" deck of playing cards consists of 52 Cards in each of the 4 suits of Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs. Each suit contains 13 cards: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King.

&lt;img src="img/deck_of_cards.png" height="320px" /&gt;

---

**Example (Four of a kind)** Find the probability that a hand of five cards in poker contains four cards of one kind.

**Solution:** By the product rule, the number of hands of five cards with four cards of one kind is the product of:
- the number of ways to pick one kind,
- the number of ways to pick the four of this kind out of the four in the deck of this kind,
- and the number of ways to pick the fifth card.

This is `$${13\choose 1}{4\choose 4}{48\choose 1} = 624.$$`

There are `\({52\choose 5}\)` different hands of five cards. Hence, the
probability that a hand contains four cards of one kind is:

`$$\frac{{13\choose 1}{4\choose 4}{48\choose 1}}{{52\choose 5}}\approx 0.00024.$$`

---
### The birthday problem

The birthday problem, a classic probability puzzle, illustrates both sampling with and without replacement in its solution.

**Given `\(k\)` people, find the probability that two have the same birthday.**

Assumptions: exclude February 29th, assume the other 365 days are equally likely and assume birthdays are independent (no twins).

.pull-left[
**Pigeonehole Principle** If `\(k\)` objects are placed into `\(n\)` boxes, where `\(k &gt; n\)`, then there must be at least one box that contains more than one object.]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/pigeons.jpeg" height="160px" /&gt;]


In the birthday problem (assuming there are 365 days in a year), with 366 or more people there is guaranteed to be at least one birthday match. So, when `\(k &gt; 365\)`, the probability is `\(1\)`.

---
### The birthday problem (cont.)

Let `\(k\leq 365\)`. A good strategy when trying to find the probability of an event is to start by thinking about whether it will be easier to find the probability of the event or the probability of its complement. In this case, it is easier to find the probability of the complement, i.e. **no two people have the same birthday**. Then the probability of having a birthday match will be 

`$$1-P(``\text{no match"})
= 1 - \frac{365\cdot 364 \cdot \ldots \cdot [365-(k-1)]}{365^k}$$`
The first value of `\(k\)` for which the probability exceeds `\(0.5\)` or `\(50\%\)` is `\(k=23\)`.

In R, the following code uses `prod` (which gives the product of a vector) to calculate the probability of at least one birthday match in a group of 23 people:


``` r
k &lt;- 23
1-prod((365-k+1):365)/365^k
```

```
## [1] 0.5072972
```

Go to https://www.mycompiler.io/new/r and replace `k &lt;- 23` with `k &lt;- 57`.

---
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="img/birthday-pb.png" height="400px" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In the above plot, we see the first value of `\(k\)` for which the probability of a match exceeds 0.5 is `\(k=23\)`. Thus, in a group of 23 people, there is a better than 50% chance that two or more of them will have the same birthday. For a quick intuition into why it should not be so surprising, note that with 23 people there are `\({23\choose 2}=253\)` pairs of people, any of which could be a birthday match.

---
### Sampling with replacement, unordered

Although not needed as often in the study of probability, it is interesting to count the number of possible samples of size `\(k\)` that can be selected out of `\(n\)` objects when **the order is irrelevant** and when sampling **with replacement**.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="img/sampling-unordered-1.png" height="150px" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

.pull-left[
To count the number of possible outcomes, notice that what we are really doing here is placing `\(n-1=2-1=1\)` dividers between `\(k\)` elements.

Or in other words, we are choosing `\(k\)` slots for the elements out of `\((n-1) + k\)` slots in total.]

.pull-right[&lt;img src="img/sampling-unordered-2.png" height="70px" /&gt;

The number of ways to select `\(k\)` items out of `\(n\)`, unordered and with replacement, is: `\({n+k-1 \choose k}={n+k-1 \choose n-1}\)`.

.footnote[
*This counting method is sometimes called the stars and bars argument, but here we used circles in place of stars. See some examples at https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi2/sec_stars-and-bars.html]

## General Definition of Probability

.definition-box[
A **probability space** consists of a sample space `\(S\)` and a probability function `\(p\)` which takes an event `\(A \subseteq S\)` as input and returns `\(p(A)\)`, a real number between `\(0\)` and `\(1\)`, as output. The function `\(p\)` must satisfy the following axioms:
 
**Axiom 1.** `\(p(∅) = 0, p(S) = 1.\)`

**Axiom 2.** If `\(A_1, A_2, \ldots\)` are disjoint events, then
`$$p\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}p(A_i)$$`
(Saying that these events are disjoint means that they are mutually exclusive: `\(A_i \cap A_j =\emptyset\)` for `\(i\neq j\)`.)
]

With this definition, we can model experiments in which outcomes are either equally likely or not equally likely
by choosing the appropriate probability function `\(p\)`.

---

**Example** For a fair coin, the probability that heads comes up when the coin is flipped equals the probability that tails comes up, so the outcomes are equally likely. Consequently, we assign the probability 1∕2 to each of the two possible outcomes. That is, `\(p(H) = p(T) = 1∕2\)`, where `\(H\)` is the event that heads comes up and `\(T\)` is the event that tails comes up.   
What probabilities should be assigned to these outcomes when the coin is biased so that heads comes up twice as often as tails?

--

**Solution:** 
For the biased coin we have `\(p(H) = 2p(T)\)`.   
Because `\(p(S) = p(H \cup T) = p(H) + p(T) = 1\)`, it follows that `\(2p(T) + p(T) = 3p(T) = 1\)`.  
We conclude that `\(p(T) = 1∕3\)` and `\(p(H) = 2∕3\)`.  

--

**Example** Suppose that a die is biased (or loaded) so that 3 appears twice as often as each other number but that the other five outcomes are equally likely. What is the probability that an odd number appears when we roll this die?

--

**Solution:** 
We want to find the probability of the event `\(E = \{1, 3, 5\}\)`.  
We have `\(p(1) = p(2) = p(4) = p(5) = p(6) = \frac{1}{7}\)` and `\(p(3) = \frac{2}{7}.\)`   
It follows that
`\(p(E) = p(1)+p(3)+p(5) = \frac{1}{7} + \frac{2}{7}+ \frac{1}{7} = \frac{4}{7}.\)`

---
### Frequentist vs Bayesian View of Probability

* The **frequentist** view of probability is that it represents a long-run frequency over a large number of repetitions of an experiment: if we say a coin has probability  of Heads, that means the coin would land Heads 50% of the time if we tossed it over and over and over.

* The **Bayesian** view of probability is that it represents a degree of belief about the event in question, so we can assign probabilities to hypotheses like ''candidate A will win the election" or ''the defendant is guilty'' even if it isn't possible to repeat the same election or the same crime over and over again.

The Bayesian and frequentist perspectives are complementary, and both will be helpful for developing intuition. 

Regardless of how we choose to interpret probability, we can use the two axioms to derive other properties of probability, and these results will hold for any valid probability function.

---
### Properties of probability

.theorem-box[
A **probability function** `\(p\)` has the following properties, for events `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`:
1. `\(p(A^c) = 1 - p(A)\)`.

2. If `\(A \subseteq B\)`, then `\(p(A) \leq  p(B)\)`.

3. `\(p (A \cup B) = p (A) + p (B) - p (A \cap B)\)`.
]

Proof of property 1: ** `\(p(A^c) = 1 - p(A)\)`**

Since `\(A\)` and `\(A^c\)` are disjoint and their union is `\(S\)`, so the 2nd axiom gives:

`$$P(S) = P(A \cup A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c)$$`
Also, `\(P(S) = 1\)` by axiom 1. Thus, `\(P(A) + P(A^c) = 1\)`

---

Proof of property 2: **If `\(A \subseteq B\)`, then `\(p(A) \leq  p(B)\)`.**

If `\(A \subseteq B\)`, then we can write `\(B\)` as the union of `\(A\)` and `\(B \cap A^c\)`, where this last event is the part of `\(B\)` not also in `\(A\)`. Since `\(A\)` and `\(B \cap A^c\)` are disjoint, we can apply the 2nd axiom:

`$$P(B) = P(A \cup (B \cap A^c)) = P(A) + P(B \cap A^c).$$`
By definition, probability is non-negative, so `\(P(B \cap A^c) \geq 0\)`, thus `\(P(B) \geq P(A)\)`

--

Proof of property 3: ** `\(p (A \cup B) = p (A) + p (B) - p (A \cap B)\)`.**

We can write `\(P(A \cup B)\)` as the union of two disjoint events: `\(A\)` and `\(B \cap A^c\)`. Then: 

`$$P(A \cup B) = P(A \cup (B \cap A^c)) = P(A) + P(B \cap A^c).$$`
Now we need to show that: `\(P(B \cap A^c) = P(B) - P(A \cap B)\)`. For that, we can use the 2nd axiom:

`\(P(A \cap B) + P(B \cap A^c) = P(B)\)`, as `\(A \cap B\)` and `\(B \cap A^c\)` are disjoint; thus `\(P(B \cap A^c) = P(B) - P(A \cap B)\)`. 

---

The third property is a special case of inclusion-exclusion, a formula for finding the probability of a union of events when the events are not necessarily disjoint:

.theorem-box[
**Inclusion-exclusion**. For any events `\(A_1, \ldots , A_n\)`, `\(p\left(\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) =\)`
`\(\small{\displaystyle\sum_i p(A_i)- \displaystyle\sum_{i&lt;j} p(A_i \cap A_j) + \displaystyle\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}p(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k)- \ldots +(-1)^{n+1} p\left(\displaystyle\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\right).}\)`
]

For three events, inclusion-exclusion says

`\(\small{p(A\cup B\cup C)=p(A)+p(B)+p(C)-p(A\cap B)-p(A\cap C)-p(B\cap C)+p(A \cap B\cap C)}\)`


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="img/inclusion-exclusion.png" height="200px" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

2. (Leibniz’s mistake) If we roll two fair dice, which is more likely: a sum of 11 or a sum of 12?  

3. (a) How many ways are there to split 12 people into 3 teams, where one team has 2 people, and the other two teams have 5 people each?
   
   (b) How many ways are there to split 12 people into 3 teams, where each team has 4 people?
   
4. (Full House) What is the probability that a poker hand contains a full house, that is, three of one kind and two of another kind?

Thank you!
